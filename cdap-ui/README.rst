Details
=======
Release Date: 03/13/2017
Base CDAP Version: 4.1
Release branch: release/4.1
Git Tag: <TBD>

Installation
============
Currently, the following manual steps need to be performed to install a UI pack. These steps will be automated in a
later CDAP release

Unix/Linux Flavors
------------------

**Standalone CDAP**

::

  $ cd ${CDAP_HOME}
  $ ./bin/cdap sdk stop
  $ zip -m -r ui-backup.zip ui
  $ unzip /path/to/download/cdap-ui-pack.zip
  $ ./bin/cdap sdk start


**CDAP Cluster**

::

  $ cd ${CDAP_HOME}                        # (usually /opt/cdap)
  $ /etc/init.d/cdap-ui stop
  $ zip -m -r ui-backup.zip ui
  $ unzip /path/to/download/cdap-ui-pack-4.1.0_p1.zip
  $ /etc/init.d/cdap-ui start



Windows
-------

**Note:** Currently, installation of the UI pack on Windows requires a zip utility - we recommend
`7zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`__ or equivalent.

1. Using the command prompt, stop the CDAP SDK

::

  $ cd ${CDAP_HOME}
  $ bin\cdap sdk stop

2. Open the ${CDAP_HOME} directory in Explorer
3. Compress the ``ui`` to save a backup, say ui-backup.zip
4. Delete the ``ui`` directory after the backup is completed
5. Extract the UI pack (cdap-ui-pack-4.1.0_p1.zip) in the ${CDAP_HOME} directory
6. A new ``ui`` directory should be created
7. Using the command prompt, start the CDAP SDK

::

  $ cd $(CDAP_HOME}
  $ bin\cdap sdk start


Steps to update Data Preparation capability
===========================================

1. Upon installing the UI Pack, go to Cask Market
2. From the **Solutions** category, follow the steps for the **Data Preparation** solution
3. Go to Data Preparation by clicking on the CDAP menu and then choosing **Data Preparation**
4. If newer version of the Data Preparation libraries have been installed, the UI will show an **Update** button.
5. Click the **Update** button to enable the newer version of Data Preparation.
